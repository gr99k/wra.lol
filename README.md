## About
I'm verlox and I typically work with C# and NodeJS. I started learning how to code about 2016-17, when I was bored and didn't feel like writing an English essay. Since then, it's grown on me, as well as learning about how computers interact with others and how they work internally. Hopefully in the future, I can get into software development.

## Current projects
* [Veylib](https://github.com/verlox/Veylib) - Library for C# applications
* [VeyAPI](https://github.com/verlox/VeyAPI) - The API my site runs off of and the auth piggy backs on
* [ServerMonitor](https://github.com/verlox/ServerMonitor) - A typescript server monitor with support for Twilio (SMS) and Discord webhooks for alerts with customizable thresholds

## Languages I know
* C#
* NodeJS
* Typescript

## Long term goals
* Learn C++
* Get a job as a backend software engineer
